# Welcome to the Takşa Factory OS Organization

This is the central GitHub home for Takşa, an open-source factory operating system from the labs of ARTPARK @ IISc.

Our mission is to empower manufacturing MSMEs with AI-powered insights and Industry 5.0 capabilities. We are building the tools to help democratize access to next-generation technology.

## About Our Mission

* Why: To help manufacturers (especially MSMEs) digitize their processes, gain AI-powered insights, and boost productivity.

* Who We Are: A community-driven project supported by ARTPARK @ IISc.

## Our Repositories
